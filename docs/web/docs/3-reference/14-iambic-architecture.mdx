# Audience

This documentation is intended for developers who wish to contribute to the noqdev/iambic project.

# Objective

IAMbic allows for bi-directional synchronization between cloud control planes and human-readable YAML files.

# IAMbic Plugins

IAMbic organizes each cloud service into individual plugins for better manageability.
For example, AWS and Google Workspace have their separate plugins.

# IAMbic Core

The core of IAMbic lays out the basic data flow and provides a command-line interface for operations.

## Command Interface

Inspired by the `git` command-line tool, IAMbic offers a variety of subcommands.

### `import`
The `import` subcommand instructs each plugin to fetch IAM configuration from the cloud and serialize it into human-readable YAML files.

### `plan`
The `plan` subcommand processes a list of template file paths, with each template tied to a specific plugin.
The plugin analyzes the current cloud state and identifies any changes needed.

### `apply`
The `apply` subcommand is similar to `plan`, but it executes changes after user confirmation.
It issues cloud API requests to bring the cloud state in line with the desired configuration.

## Human-Readable YAML Files

Each plugin supports specific template types. For example, the AWS plugin handles IAM User, IAM Group, IAM Role, and Identity Center
Permission Sets. IAMbic employs the Pydantic library to declare schemas for these templates.

YAML is chosen for portability, with Pydantic providing validation. Metadata, such as `identifier`, are kept only in the local
YAML files and are not persistent in the vendor's cloud API. This approach allows IAMbic to implement features, like expiration
mechanisms, that may not be natively supported by the cloud service.

# Git Integrations

IAMbic integrates with Git to support team collaboration. Teams are expected to commit their IAMbic templates to a Git repository.
IAMbic then periodically imports the cloud state into this repository, mirroring it on the default branch.
Team members can create branches for changes, submit them for peer review, and IAMbic coordinates the plan and apply processes
before merging changes back into the default branch.
