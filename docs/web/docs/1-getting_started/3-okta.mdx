title: Okta
---

Welcome to our Okta documentation! This tutorial will guide you through setting up IAMbic to manage your Okta organization
and use it to create, manipulate, and expire groups, application assignments, and users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

* A local Git repository to store your IAMbic templates (See [Install and Configure](/getting_started/configuring_iambic) for guidance on setting this up)
* Administrative access to an existing Okta organization. If you do not have an Okta Organization, you can
create a developer organization at [developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com/).
* An Okta API token with administrative privileges.

To make it easier to run the commands in this tutorial, we recommend setting up environment variables that will be used
in the subsequent commands on this page. These environment variables are not needed for regular IAMbic usage, and in a
production environment, we recommend storing these values in AWS Secrets Manager and extending the Iambic configuration
to load them during runtime.

```bash
export EMAIL=<your_okta_email_address>
export OKTA_DOMAIN=<your_okta_domain> # e.g.: https://dev-12345.okta.com/. Get the `dev-12345` portion, specific to your environment from the Okta portal.
export OKTA_IDP_NAME=<your_okta_org_name> # e.g.: development. This is a friendly name to identify your Okta organization.  Any arbitrary string will work here.
export OKTA_API_TOKEN=<your_okta_api_token> # An administrative API token for your Okta organization, follow the instructions in the following steps to create one.
export OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL=<test_email> # A test-user e-mail address to use in this tutorial
```

### Setup

#### Create an Okta API Token

In this section, you will create an API token that allows iambic to manage application and group memberships by
signing in to Okta.

From within Okta
1. Click on Security
1. Click on API
1. Click on Tokens
1. Click on "Create Token"
1. Create a token for Iambic. This token will be used to authenticate Iambic with Okta.
1. Copy the value of the token.

</details>

Save the value of this API token for the next stpes.

####  Configure iambic for Okta management

You have a few options for configuring IAMbic to manage your Okta Organization. You can either:

1. Use the setup wizard to configure IAMbic (`iambic setup`)
1. Write your Okta configuration manually

If you use the setup wizard, you'll first need to configure an AWS account. As a part of the setup process,
IAMbic will create an AWS Secret to store your Okta API token. If you choose to configure IAMbic manually,
you can either leverage AWS Secrets Manager to store your token, or you can store it in a local file that
will be merged into your IAMbic configuration but won't be checked into your `iambic-templates` Git repository.

Steps configuring Okta through the setup wizard:
<details>

1. Execute `iambic setup`
1. Select `Okta`
1. Complete the steps with your `OKTA_IDP_NAME`, `OKTA_DOMAIN` and `OKTA_API_TOKEN`
1. In the end, your iambic_config.yml will have an `extends` section with your secret.

</details>

The steps below will walk you through configuring IAMbic manually.
1. Import existing Okta Groups into your IAMbic templates repository

#### Setup Wizard

If you'd like to use the setup wizard, you can run `iambic setup` and follow the prompts. The setup wizard will
create an AWS Secret to store your Okta API token. You can then use the IAMbic CLI to manage your Okta organization.

#### Manually Configure IAMbic

As an alternative to the setup wizard, you can set up IAMbic manually.

With your token in hand, create `config/secrets.yaml`
in your `iambic-templates` Git repo if it doesn't already exist:

:::danger

Never commit secrets Git. Ensure that you have a  `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your `iambic-templates`
repository that is configured to ignore secrets.yaml files with `**/secrets.yaml`. [Learn more](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) about `.gitignore` files.

:::

```bash
mkdir -p config
cat <<EOF > config/secrets.yaml
secrets:
  okta:
    organizations:
      - idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
        org_url: $OKTA_DOMAIN
        api_token: $OKTA_API_TOKEN
EOF
```

From the base directory of your IAMbic templates repository, your directory structure should resemble the following. You may
have more files if you've recently imported your cloud resources.

```bash
tree .
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
```

<!-- #TODO As with the google page, these headings should link to, and match, headings below -->


<!--
Email: <input type="text" id="inputOktaEmail" value="user@example.com" onInput={() => updateText(document.getElementById('inputOktaEmail'), 'outputOktaEmail')} />

Okta Domain: <input type="text" id="inputOktaDomain" value="https://dev-12345.okta.com/" onInput={() => updateText(document.getElementById('inputOktaDomain'), 'outputOktaDomain')} />

-->

<!-- TODO: Variables in code blocks: https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1095#issuecomment-967511279 -->

<!--  Email: <input type="text" id="inputOktaEmail" defaultValue="user@example.com" onInput={() => updateText(document.getElementById('inputOktaEmail'), 'outputOktaEmail')}/>  -->

<!--  <label id={'outputOktaEmail'}>user@example.com</label> -->

<!--   export const OktaEmail = () => <label id='outputOktaEmail'>user@example.com</label> -->

<!--  <OktaEmail />  -->


### Import existing Okta Users, Groups, and Apps

In this section, you will manually import your existing Okta Users, Groups, and Apps into your IAMbic templates repository. In a production environment, automation provided by Iambic would ensure that Git is always up-to-date with the
cloud resources in your production environment.

Run the following command in the root of your `iambic-templates` repository to import your existing Okta Groups:

```bash
iambic import
```

If you have Okta Groups defined, your iambic-templates repository should have a `okta/groups` directory with a subdirectory for each Okta organization you have defined.

That's it, you've completed the setup configuration connecting your Okta Groups to IAMBic. Now you will practice using IAMbic to execute basic group management skills.

### Create an Okta Group

Iambic uses a YAML file to describe the desired state of an Okta Group. In this section, we will create a group called `iambic-test-group` in your domain. Ensure that the environment variables you've set previously are still configured, and also ensure that your credentials are working properly by running the import process from the previous section.

Run the following set of commands from the root of your `iambic-templates` repository to create a new Okta Group template:

```bash
mkdir -p resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::Group
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: 'description'
  members:
    - username: $EMAIL
EOF
```


Apply the template to your Okta Organization by running the following command:

:::info

In a production environment, this would be handled by a command issued on a Github Pull Request after the appropriate approvals have been made.

:::

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

Confirm that the group has been created by running the following command and visiting the URL in your browser:

```bash
echo $OKTA_DOMAIN/admin/groups
```

By now the directory of your `iambic-templates` repository should resemble the following, and may include other resources that you've imported:

```bash
$ tree .
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
├──resources
    ├── okta
    │   └── group
    │       └── $OKTA_IDP_NAME
    │           ├── iambic-test-group.yaml
```


### Provide temporary ("break-glass") access to an Okta Group

In this section, we will update the group added in the previous section to configure the access to expire in two minutes,
simulating a very short break-glass request. In order to strive for least privilege while accomodating this request,
we will add an expiration date to the user's membership in the group. Run the following command to replace the previous
group you created with a new one that includes the additional user and an expiration date, and then apply that change:

:::tip

If a specific expiration date is provided without a timezone, Iambic will assume the timezone is UTC.
If a timezone is provided, Iambic will use that timezone.

:::

```bash
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::Group
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  members:
    - username: $EMAIL
      expires_at: in 2 minutes
EOF
```

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

After applying the change, notice that the `expires_at` date in the template was converted from a relative expiration time ("in two minutes") to an absolute date (Example: "2021-05-20T15:00:00-04:00"). This allows Iambic to know exactly when the request should be expired.

Confirm that the user was added by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```bash
echo $OKTA_DOMAIN/admin/groups
```

After a couple of minutes, the request should expire. In a production deployment, this process would be automatic. But for the purposes of testing, you can manually expire the request by re-running the apply command after two minutes have passed:

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

### Create an Okta User

In this section, you will create a new Okta User using IAMbic. We'll start
by writing a template for the user. We'll use the `iambic apply` command to
create the user in Okta. You should be operating out of a local Git repository.


```bash
mkdir -p resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::User
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
properties:
  profile:
    email: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
    firstName: Example
    lastName: User
    login: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
  status: provisioned
  username: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
EOF
```

Run the following command to create the user:

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
```

### Add an attribute to the user

```bash
mkdir -p resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::User
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
properties:
  profile:
    email: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
    firstName: Example
    lastName: User
    login: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
    title: Temporary User
  status: provisioned
  username: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
EOF
```

Run the following command to create the user:

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
```
### Add the user to an Okta group

In this section, we will add the user already created to the group we created in the previous section.

Run the following command to replace the previous group you created with a new one that includes the new user:

```bash
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/group/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::Group
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  members:
    - username: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
EOF
```

Run the `apply` command to have IAMbic update the group:

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/group/$OKTA_DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```


### Manually Create an Okta Application

IAMbic doesn't support creating or deleting Okta applications yet, however it can
manage application assignments from applications that were imported from
Okta. During this section, we are going to create an application in the Okta UI,
and then import it into IAMbic with the `iambic import` command.

1. In the Okta UI, navigate to the Applications page and click the "Create App Integration" button.
2. Select "API Services" and click "Next".
3. Enter `test_application` for the name, and click "Save".

After creating the application, run `iambic import` to import the application into
your iambic templates repository.

The output should be written to this file:

resources/okta/app/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/test_application.yaml

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::App
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: test_application
  id: 12345
  status: ACTIVE
```

### Provide temporary access to an application

```bash
cat <<EOF >> resources/okta/app/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/test_application.yaml
  assignments:
    - user: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
      expires_at: tomorrow
EOF
```

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/app/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/test_application.yaml
```

### Expire the application assignment

Modify the yaml file and set the expires_at property to a relative or
absolute date in the past:

```yaml
expires_at: yesterday
```

### Delete the Okta application

To delete the application, we can either set `deleted: true` or an `expires_at: yesterday` at the top level of the application, and then run `iambic apply resources/okta/app/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/test_application.yaml`:

Some examples of how this might look are below:

With `deleted: true`:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::App
deleted: true
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: test_application
  id: 12345
  status: ACTIVE
```

With `expires_at`:

```yaml
expires_at: yesterday
template_type: NOQ::Okta::App
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: test_application
  id: 12345
  status: ACTIVE
```

The difference between them is when you set `expires_at`, iambic changes the file with the date and add the `deleted` tag.

Apply the changes once done:

```bash
iambic apply resources/okta/app/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/test_application.yaml
```


### Delete the Okta User

The process for deleting a user is relatively similar. We can either set `deleted: true` or an `expires_at: yesterday`
tag at the top level of the user, and then run `iambic apply resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml`.

Run the following command to edit the file:

```bash
cat <<EOF > resources/okta/user/$OKTA_IDP_NAME/$OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::User
idp_name: $OKTA_IDP_NAME
deleted: true
properties:
  profile:
    email: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
    firstName: Example
    lastName: User
    login: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
    title: Temporary User
  status: provisioned
  username: $OKTA_TEST_USER_EMAIL
EOF
```
