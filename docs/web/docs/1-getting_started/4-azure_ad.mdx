title: Azure Active Directory
---

This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing and managing
users and groups in Azure Active Directory (AD).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

* A local Git repository to store your IAMbic templates (See [Install and Configure](/getting_started/configuring_iambic) for guidance on setting this up).
* An Azure subscription with an active tenant
* Access to your Azure Active Directory tenant as a Global Administrator

## Setup

### Create an Azure application for IAMbic

In this section, you will create an Azure application that will allows IAMbic to manage user and group memberships.

From within Azure AD:
1. Click on App Registrations -> New Registrations

### Create a basic Azure AD Configuration for IAMbic

#### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

We recommend running `iambic setup`, which will guide you through the process of creating a
basic Azure AD configuration for IAMbic. If you have not run `iambic setup` before,
you will be prompted to connect to an AWS account first. The setup wizard requires an
AWS account because it uses AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive secrets like your
Azure AD credentials.

#### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure IAMbic manually, follow these steps:

1. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AZURE_IDP_NAME=<your_azure_ad_domain> # Any friendly name will work here. This will be used in the directory structure, so we recommend avoiding spaces and special characters.
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your_azure_tenant_id> # ex: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your_azure_client_id>
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_azure_client_secret>
export AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL=<test_email> # A test-user e-mail address to use in this tutorial
```

2. Add the following lines to your secrets.yaml file,
  or to your existing AWS Secrets Manager secret for IAMbic:

```yaml
secrets:
  azure_ad:
    organizations:
      - idp_name: $AZURE_IDP_NAME
        tenant_id: $AZURE_TENANT_ID
        client_id: $AZURE_CLIENT_ID
        client_secret: $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

3. From the base directory of your IAMbic templates repository, run `tree .`
to confirm that the directory structure includes the following:

```bash
tree .
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
```

### Import existing users and groups using templates

In this section, you will manually import existing Azure AD Users and Groups into your
IAMbic templates repository. In a production environment, automation provided by Iambic
would ensure that Git is always up-to-date with the cloud resources in your production
environment. This allows you to monitor the history of your resources via Git History.

1. Run the following command in the root of your iambic-templates repository to
  import your existing Azure AD Users and Groups:

```bash
iambic import
```

2. If you have existing Azure AD Users and/or Groups, your iambic-templates
repository should now have applicable directories under resources/azure_ad.

That's it, you've completed the setup configuration connecting your Azure AD Users
and Groups to IAMbic. Now you will practice using IAMbic to manage Azure AD Users and Groups.

## Practice

### Create a new user

In this section, you will create a new Azure AD User using IAMbic. We'll start
by writing a template for the user. We'll use the `iambic apply` command to
create the user in Azure AD. You should be operating out of a local Git repository.

```bash
mkdir -p resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME
cat <<EOF > resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/$AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
template_type: NOQ::AzureAD::User
idp_name: $AZURE_IDP_NAME
properties:
  display_name: Example User
  given_name: Example
  username: $AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL
EOF
```

Run:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/$AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
```

Observe that a new user was created in Azure Active Directory. Also notice that
the ID of the user was added to the template in Git. In a production setup,
IAMbic would automatically update the template with the user's ID, and commit
the change. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will commit the change
manually.

```bash
git add resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/$AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
git commit -m "Add new user to Azure AD"
```

### Create a new Group

In this section, you will create a new Azure AD Group using IAMbic.

```bash
mkdir -p resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/
cat <<EOF > resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::AzureAD::Group
idp_name: $AZURE_IDP_NAME
properties:
  name: iambic_test_group
  description: A test group to use with IAMbic
EOF
```

Apply the change:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
```

Commit the change to your local Git repository:

```bash
git add resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
git commit -m "Add new user to Azure AD"
```


### Provide temporary ("break-glass") access to an Azure AD Group

We're going to add the user we created earlier to our new group temporarily.
We'll use the `expires_at` property to specify when the user should be removed from the group.
`expires_at` can be a relative timestamp. Once our request is approved and merged in by
IAMbic, the relative timestamp will be converted to an absolute timestamp. This means that if
a user requests access to a group for 4 hours, the clock will start ticking down from the time
the request is approved and applied, not the time the request is made.

```bash
cat <<EOF >> resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
  members:
    - name: $AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL
      data_type: user
      expires_at: tomorrow
EOF
```

Run:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
```

After applying the change, you should see the user added to the group in the Active Directory portal IAMbic
also updated the `iambic_test_group.yaml` template with the user's ID, and converted the relative expiration date
to an absolute expiration date.

```bash
git add resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
git commit -m "Add user to group"
```


### Expire a group membership

Modify the `resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml` file, and
change the `expires_at` property to `yesterday`. The member should look something like this:

```yaml
  members:
    - name: testuser@example.com
      data_type: user
      expires_at: yesterday
      id: 12345-67890-12345-67890
```

Run:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
```

After applying, run a `git diff` to see the changes made to the template. You should see
that the user was removed from the group completely. Confirm in the Azure AD console.

An alternative way of removing a user from a group is to remove the user from the template
completely, and apply, or set `deleted: true` for the specific user.

Let's commit our change:

```bash
git add resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
git commit -m "Remove user from group"
```


### Expire the group

We can also configure our entire group to expire. We could also set `deleted: true` on the group.

Create an `expires_at` attribute at the top of the group template, and set it to a date in the past.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```yaml
expires_at: 2021-01-01
template_type: NOQ::AzureAD::Group
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: iambic_test_group
  description: A test group to use with IAMbic
  group_id: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  mail_nickname: iambic_test_group
```

Run:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/group/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/iambic_test_group.yaml
```

Observe that the group is deleted in Azure AD, and the template is removed from Git.

```bash
git status
```

### Expire the user

Let's now expire our user. Modify
the `resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/$AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml` file, and
set the `expires_at` property to a date in the past.

```yaml
expires_at: 2021-01-01
template_type: NOQ::AzureAD::User
idp_name: development
properties:
  display_name: Example User
  given_name: Example
  user_id: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  username: testuser@example.com
```

Run:

```bash
iambic apply resources/azure_ad/user/$AZURE_IDP_NAME/$AZURE_TEST_USER_EMAIL.yaml
```

Observe that the user was deleted after the change was applied.
